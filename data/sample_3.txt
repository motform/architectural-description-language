And once again I erase,
Ideas rubbed against the grays of my brain,
Obliterated.
Drafting a design again,
Plotting for the never ending end,
Reworking , redesigning, unending.
Months and days, weeks and years,
Time passed, ideas changing,
Crits received, its unending.
The endless scibbles,
The bloody blotches on butter, more changes,
And once again I erase.
