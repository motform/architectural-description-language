# Man Decides by Anshumali Baruah

Lines on paper, stand out
The lines transform into concrete
Glass and steel find their places.
A domain is defined.

Man walks into this domain
Feelings of acceptance or refusal accompany him
A fate is decided.

The domain constructed:
Finds its fulfilment in its users
Users and activities act as one
Thus giving this domain a meaning:
A sense of being built.
But if this purpose falter
The domain degrades
Leaving a void in its place.
A pain for the creator
Irreparable to the user.

But would it not be wiser:
To include man as the lines are drawn;
To indulge him in the choices;
And thus arrive at a successful domain
Creating harmony for all?
