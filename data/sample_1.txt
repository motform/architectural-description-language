# Construction Today by Rema Mohan

A work in progress…
This evolution so carelessly labeled life.
Never-ending chapters of ethereal yesteryears
Pave the road of existence for yet another day.
Dreams, visions and experiences…
Architectural designs of some cosmic happenings,
Decades in the making,
Builds an apex of truths.
As though peering through a kaleidoscope
While drafting these blueprints,
Structure shapes and re-shapes itself
As if molded from paper mache.
Oddly enough, the heart is molded of glass.
