# Architecture by O. Pulama Devi

Along the simple line
a stream of pebbles
on the unruffled forehead
of a wall
in joyful and large openings.
where numerous geometrical shapes
border an innovative perception
movement meets stillness
hey there you are
Architecture
art and technicality of fantasy and creativity
there your beauty resides
along the line
on a wall
and everywhere
an essence providing meaning to all forms
I proclaim your motionless dance
